The source to drive the iv4lw project.

(binary) project files for schematics and layout in EAGLE format are available in the Eagle-Projects repository.

This code targets the atmega328p microcontroller and can be compiled with avr-gcc in Linux.  Makefile changes should be possible to get it building on Windows, but this is untested.

This project contains code written by Pascal Stang (parts of avrlib), and Objective Development (the V-USB driver).
